## Design Philosophy
NulkaCLI was built on the premise that prompt-engineering should be decoupled from python application logic. To achieve this, NulkaCLI uses a YAML/Markdown split configuration structure. 

All meta configurations are stored in YAML, while long-form instructions, personas, and dynamically updated rules are kept cleanly in Markdown files.
